I propose to use this file to describe the state of repository (date, author, nature of modification, result)

10/21/2016  Doume Create branch cm-13.0
  I have neutralized hostapd into BoardConfig.mk (compilation fails otherwise)
    Note : IMHO, hostapd has no sense on a tablet having no telephony to share !
  I have neutralized BOARD_HAS_BLUETOOTH_MTK into BoardConfig.mk line 103
  
  To have a successfull build, 
  I was forced to create manually following folder :
   mkdir -p ./out/target/product/Tab2A710F/obj/KERNEL_OBJ/usr
   
   I did'nt find where to add this command, to create folder during build process ! ! !
   
   Otherwise, a fatal error occurs :
   ---------------------------------
   make: *** No rule to build the target « /storage2/cm13.0/out/target/product/Tab2A710F/obj/KERNEL_OBJ/usr », 
     required for « /storage2/cm13.0/out/target/product/Tab2A710F/obj/SHARED_LIBRARIES/libtinyalsa_intermediates/mixer.o ». 
     Stop.

  At 17:36 CET time :
      Build success.
      
  But : the rom does'nt boot : After Lenovo logo, no CM boot animation ==> reboot in recovery !

10/22/2016   Tirth  Fix build error about missing directory
   Problem of fatal error on build would be fixed
