CyanogenMod for Lenovo Tab2 A7-10F, branch cm12.1

Local manifests for building cm12.1 rom, for tablet Lenovo Tab2 A7-10F

How to use :

Yes all the source code is available on Github.

These are the steps to build this rom.

Install a suitable OS. You can use a virtual machine running Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit, or a physical one : both are supported.

Prepare the system, do steps 1, 2 and 5 of this guide, to configure your development machine :

WARNING : To have success when building ROMs from repository, it's required to use Java-7 JRE (1.7) If you don't use this one, you'll have unpredictable errors, like C header files malformed.

It's recommanded to have a PATH pointing the right Java JRE at first position, in your environment !

Then run these commands:

mkdir YOUR_ WORKING_DIR

cd YOUR_WORKING_DIR

repo init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b cm-12.1

mkdir .repo/local_manifests

curl https://raw.github.com/Cyanogenmod-for-Lenovo-Tab2A7-10F/android/cm12.1/Tab2A710F_manifest.xml > .repo/local_manifests/Tab2A710F_manifest.xml

repo sync

The sync will take a while and download something like 15 GB of source code.

Finally build the rom with these commands:

� source build/envsetup.sh

� brunch Tab2A710F

If all goes well this will create a zip file into 'out' folder, that can be flashed on the tablet!
